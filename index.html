As far as informal settlements go, Los Angeles is one of the most unusual you will ever find.
Here, on hot days, residents leave windows and doors open when they’re not home. The shacks are all numbered and have their own neatly-kept, fenced off gardens, some filled with flowers and vegetables.
</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="docs-internal-guid-c0e68aeb-8975-af1c-c36b-1e71d7d9c470"><span>
And unlike “normal” informal settlements where shacks are packed together, creating an ever-present fire danger, in Los Angeles there are spacious paths between individual homes. In the distance, a group of residents moves around the settlement picking up litter, the reason why the area is so neat and litter free.
</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="docs-internal-guid-c0e68aeb-8975-af1c-c36b-1e71d7d9c470"></span><span id="docs-internal-guid-c0e68aeb-8976-57f4-d02b-043c148dfdd0">
Situated on the Driftsands Nature Reserve along the N2, south of the Cape Town, Los Angeles attracts a lot of attention with its orderly-arranged shacks, neat dirt roads, and organised yards with vegetable gardens.
</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="docs-internal-guid-c0e68aeb-8976-8c27-ecf8-7207c38026cb">
But Los Angeles, like most other informal settlements scattered across South Africa, has no electricity, not enough toilets and too few taps. Many of its residents struggle to make ends meet.
Weekend Argus visited the settlement recently as part of a data-driven investigation into informal settlements across the city that were not counted in the 2011 Census. What the data revealed was that a section of Los Angeles was not counted. But it is unclear whether this was an oversight by StatsSA enumerators, or whether it’s because of post-2011 growth in Los Angeles, which has almost doubled in size in the five years since the Census.
The settlement has been in existence for at least 20 years. It got its name from its location in a wetland close to a stream, which mimics the geography of its namesake in the United States of America.

“The name also comes from us being ‘lost angels’ living in a hidden area,” said Stanford Dasheka, chairperson of the local residents’ committee.
Although no visa or flights are needed to get to the local LA, its residents live by a code of conduct which they expect visitors to follow.
<br>
“Here, we respect one another. We keep this place clean because if we don’t, we will suffer from diseases and cross-contamination,” Dasheka said.
<br>“If someone misbehaves, we call a meeting and issue a warning,” he said.
Dasheka, who runs a spaza shop in the settlement, said the residents got along with one another and are involved in initiatives to keep the area clean and habitable.<br>
“We have two main problems, electricity and development,” Dasheka said.
</span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-c0e68aeb-8976-f06b-451e-715e57a5524a"><span>
The settlement is not officially electrified but residents illegally connect to an electricity supply from low cost houses in Driftsands, about 1km away. Cables carrying power to LA run across a stream covered with reeds to reach the settlement. <br>
“We have lost at least seven men because of this problem. Three were electrocuted in 2015 alone,” he said. The settlement had been ignored by its ward councillor and the City of Cape Town, some residents claim.
Several meetings were held with the City, but there had been no satisfactory result, he said, adding: <br>“How are we expected to live without electricity?”<br>
Ninini Qweliso, who has lived in LA for about nine years, said: “Sometimes we do not have water and have to carry buckets on our heads from Driftsands. Some of us rely on our gardens for food, when there is no water we really suffer,” she said.

The servicing of toilets was another problem for the residents, with many cubicles broken, posing a health risk, Qweliso said. The result is that many residents are forced to use a dune at the rear of the settlement as an outdoor toilet that is permeated with the fetid smell of human waste.<br>
There is no consensus on the number of residents on the settlement. Dasheka said there were approximately 1200 people, but ward councillor, Cynthia Claasen said there were only 500.
But a recent risk assessment report by the Research Alliance for Disaster and Risk Reduction (RADRR) unit at Stellenbosch University reported that a 2010 enumeration of Los Angeles by NGO Community Organisation Resource Centre (COURC) counted 375 structures. These were home to about to about 870 residents.
</span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-c0e68aeb-8976-f06b-451e-715e57a5524a"><span>
“During the scoping exercise for this risk assessment, the community leader claimed that five years later this number is now closer to 550 (structures),” RADRR reported. “ ... although when approached the City of Cape Town’s most recent official count was 436 structures, and this after a number of recently constructed additional dwellings had been removed by the Human Settlements department. Thus, one can assume a population of over 1000 people (working on even a basic estimate of 3 people per household)”, the report said.<br>
Claasen dismissed claims that the lack of services in the area was not being addressed.<br> “I’ve had meetings with officials from the Department of Human Settlements and Eskom and the community to address electrification in the area. We are still waiting for Eskom to come back to us because their financial year ended in February,” she said.

The land on which the settlement is situated is owned by the Western Cape government, while the reserve falls under Cape Nature. The assessment report states that water and sanitation infrastructure were only erected after the settlement was officially recognised by the municipality as a residential area in 2006.<br>
Claasen said that the sub-council responsible for the area would soon meet with the human settlements MEC to resolve the long standing issue over the ownership of the land.
<br>“We have been waiting for the deproclamation of that land since it was land owned by the Western Cape government. The sub-council will meet with the Minister pertaining to this matter shortly,” Claasen said.<br>
So perhaps one day Los Angeles could become a normal suburb of Cape Town, with brick houses that each have their their own toilets and access to water.
And the fetid dune that now serves as a toilet can be turned into a playground for the children who live there.
